#### **Project Overview: COVID-19 Data Cleaning and Visualization Using Python**

This project focuses on understanding the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic through data. The dataset was taken from Our World in Data and included daily records of new cases, deaths, vaccinations, and population details for many countries. While the dataset was large and useful, it contained issues such as missing values, blank entries, and incorrect date formats. The first step was to clean the data to make it ready for analysis.

Using the pandas library in Python, all empty strings were removed, extra spaces were trimmed, and date values were fixed to the correct format. This made it possible to group and filter the data by months or years. Missing or incorrect entries were also handled carefully to make sure the results would be accurate.

Once the data was cleaned, it was saved as a new CSV file for future use. This file was then used to create charts and graphs to better understand the information.

The second part of the project involved creating different types of visualizations using the matplotlib library. A line chart was made to show daily COVID-19 cases in India, which helped to see the rise and fall of cases. A bar chart was created to compare the number of deaths in different countries. A horizontal bar chart showed which countries had the highest vaccination numbers.

A scatter plot was also made to see if there was a connection between the size of a countryâ€™s population and the total number of COVID-19 cases. Another chart was made to compare total COVID-19 cases over time in India, the United States, and Brazil. This chart was later adjusted to show total cases year by year for easier comparison.

From these charts, it became clear how different countries were affected by the virus. Some had higher cases, others had more deaths, and some had better vaccination numbers. These visual tools made it easier to understand the data.

This project shows how raw data can be cleaned, organized, and used to make simple but powerful charts. Using only pandas and matplotlib, the project turned messy data into clear visual information that helps explain how COVID-19 spread across the world.
